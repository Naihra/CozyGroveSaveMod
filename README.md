# Save location

I've only used these with a save from the Steam version, but I don't see any reason why they wouldn't work with Apple Arcade as well, as long as you can access the save files.

# How to use
The first time download everything as a zip, and unzip it anywhere. Then run the .html you want in any browser.

## Show data
These apps don't alter the save file in any way, they only take information from it and show it.

### Animal List
Shows all the animals on map and lists their details, including if they are hungry.

The food names are the in-save coded ones.

### Finder
Locates any item that's on the ground.

Default option allows to search any string, including "_" to show everything. Hit Enter or press the button to search.

The Imp option is not 100% reliable, sometimes imps just don't spawn where the save says they have. Or they disappear at reload.

### Imp Finder
The Imp finder option of the Finder for faster access.

## Modify data
These apps create a new save file from the information of the one you load. My recommendation is load the save in another slot. I've used all 3 of them many times now and haven't had any issues, but use them under your own responsability and always make a copy before.

Name of the slots are "cg_save.sf" "cg_save_2.sf" "cg_save_3.sf".

### Essence Recycler
Takes essence from your inventory only, not from storage. 

In the current version you get 3 lower rank essences for each one you recycle.

They max at 50, if it were to generate more than that the excess will be lost, but different stacks are treated separatedly.

### Sort Collection
Sorts the items in collection.

When there are no options the order is alphabetical.

Shells, fish and flowers can be grouped by color or rarity.

Only the marked categories will be sorted.

### Sort Wardrobe
Sorts the clothes in wardrobe alphabetically, which puts the items of the same category together.

Unfortunately there is no pattern I could find to sort them in other way.

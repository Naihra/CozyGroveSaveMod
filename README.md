# CURRENTLY APPS DON'T WORK FOR THE NEWEST STEAM BETA UPDATE (2.3.0)

I've only used these with a save from the Steam version, but I don't see any reason why they wouldn't work with Apple Arcade as well, as long as you can access the save files.

# How to use
You can download everything as a zip, and unzip it anywhere, or just the html you want, but the DATA folder needs to be in the same directory.

Then run the .html in any browser. 

## Show data
These apps don't alter the save file in any way, they only take information from it and show it.

### Animal List
Shows all the animals on map and lists their details, including if they are hungry.

The food names are the in-save coded ones.

The table can be sorted by clicking on the header.

### Finder
Locates any item that's on the ground, can use any of the preset selection or input a string in "Custom search", then press Enter or the button.

Shells and critters not in collection will show highlighted.

## Modify data
These apps create a new save file from the information of the one you load. My recommendation is load the save in another slot. I've used all 3 of them many times now and haven't had any issues, but use them under your own responsability and always make a copy before.

Name of the slots are "cg_save.sf" "cg_save_2.sf" "cg_save_3.sf".

### Essence Recycler
Takes essence and greens from your inventory only, not from storage. 

In the current version you get 3 lower rank essences for each one you recycle and 2 greens.

They max at 50, if it were to generate more than that the excess will be lost, but different stacks are treated separatedly.

### Furniture Recycler
Turns furniture into its corresponding crafting recipe.

Reads the furniture items from inventory (not storage) and present a list so the items to be recycled can be selected by clicking on the line. If the recipe has already been obtained it will be marked with "Have".

Having more than one item in the slot will cause all of them to disappeared and be replaced with the recipe.

### Sort Collection
Sorts the items in collection.

When there are no options the order is alphabetical.

Shells, fish, flowers and critters can be grouped in different ways.

Only the marked categories will be sorted.

Grouped by type/season, type/color, color.

### Inventory Expander
Expands or reduces the size of the backpack and the storage. To make it less of a cheat there is an optional "Donation" field, where you can input the amount you want to spend on the upgrade.

The input values for rows can be positive or negative, and it will add or remove 4 slots per row to keep the inventories consistent. If after removing the slots you end up with less than what you should have based on the upgrades you've already purchased the game will add them when you load the save.

### Imp Rescue
Can be used to move imps that are not showing in game, usually because they have spawned in safe areas.
